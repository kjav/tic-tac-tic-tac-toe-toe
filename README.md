## Running the code

### CLI game

The Python CLI implementation depends on Python 3.6+ and no external dependencies.

It can be run with:
`python3 board.py`


## Running the tests

There are currently some very basic 'tests' for the Python CLI implementation, which is really just an example of exercising the main APIs!

Run with:
`python3 test.py`
